# [Twig Template Engine for PHP][published url]
## Instructor: [Jeremy McPeak][instructor url]


Embedding HTML in your PHP is one of the worst decisions you can make. Not only is it a pain to write, it's also a pain to maintain. If you use a fully-fledged framework like Laravel, then you don't have to worry about how HTML is generated. But if you're using bare-metal PHP, you should use a template engine.

In this Coffee Break Course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Jeremy McPeak will introduce you to Twig: a flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP. You'll learn some of its easy-to-use syntax as Jeremy shows you how to inherit templates and create content blocks.
